# MachineLearning

These Jupyter notebooks were created as exercises for a module. Althought, the basic structure was designed by the Instrukor, all code was written by myself without any solutions given at any time.
While the original questions have been removed, the content has been structured to showcase the tasks and solutions undertaken during the exercises.

How to Use
Feel free to explore each notebook to understand the concepts and techniques applied. Code cells are annotated with comments to explain the functionality. Additionally, markdown cells provide context and insights into the reasoning behind certain decisions. 
The code is not executable because some important aspects have been deliberately removed

Acknowledgements
The original exercises were developed by Moritz Kirschmann for educational purposes.
